1. Pod: A pod is the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model. It represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster.
Implementation: A pod is created by defining the desired state of a container in a YAML file, which is then submitted to the Kubernetes API for deployment.
Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: mypod
spec:
containers:
name: mycontainer
image: myimage:v1


2. ReplicationController: A ReplicationController ensures that a specified number of replicas of a pod are running at any given time.
Implementation: A ReplicationController is created by defining the desired state of a pod and the desired number of replicas in a YAML file, which is then submitted to the Kubernetes API for deployment.
Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
name: myrc
spec:
replicas: 3
selector:
app: myapp
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: myapp
spec:
containers:
- name: mycontainer
image: myimage:v1


3. Service: A Service provides a stable network identity and load balancing for a set of pods.
Implementation: A Service is created by defining the desired state of a Service in a YAML file, which is then submitted to the Kubernetes API for deployment.
Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: myservice
spec:
selector:
app: myapp

targetPort: 8080
type: ClusterIP
These are just a few examples of the implementation and code snippets for common Kubernetes terminologies.


4. Deployment: A Deployment provides a declarative way to manage the desired state of a set of replicas of a pod.
Implementation: A Deployment is created by defining the desired state of a set of replicas of a pod in a YAML file, which is then submitted to the Kubernetes API for deployment. The Deployment ensures that the specified number of replicas are running and automatically replaces any failed or deleted replicas.
Example:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
name: mydeployment
spec:
replicas: 3
selector:
matchLabels:
app: myapp
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: myapp
spec:
containers:
- name: mycontainer
image: myimage:v1


5. StatefulSet: A StatefulSet provides a way to manage stateful applications, such as databases, in a cluster. It provides stable network identities, persistent storage, and ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
Implementation: A StatefulSet is created by defining the desired state of a set of replicas of a pod in a YAML file, which is then submitted to the Kubernetes API for deployment. The StatefulSet provides unique network identities and persistent storage for each replica.
Example:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
name: mystatefulset
spec:
replicas: 3
selector:
matchLabels:
app: myapp
template:
metadata:
labels:
app: myapp
spec:
containers:
- name: mycontainer
image: myimage:v1
serviceName: myservice
volumeClaimTemplates:
metadata:
name: myvolume
spec:
accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
resources:
requests:
storage: 1Gi


6. ConfigMap: A ConfigMap is a resource that holds configuration data as key-value pairs. It can be consumed by pods or other parts of a cluster.
Implementation: A ConfigMap is created by defining the desired state of a set of configuration data in a YAML file, which is then submitted to the Kubernetes API for deployment. The ConfigMap can be referenced by pods or other parts of a cluster using environment variables or command-line arguments.
Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
name: myconfigmap
data:
mykey: myvalue


7. Secret: A Secret is a resource that holds sensitive information, such as passwords and keys, in an encrypted format. It can be consumed by pods or other parts of a cluster.
Implementation: A Secret is created by defining the desired state of a set of sensitive data in a YAML file, which is then submitted to the Kubernetes API for deployment. The Secret can be referenced by pods or other parts of a cluster using environment variables or command-line arguments.
Example:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
name: mysecret
type: Opaque
data:
mykey: myvalue

8. Service: A Service is a resource that defines a logical set of pods and a policy for accessing them. It provides stable network identities and load balancing for pods.
Implementation: A Service is created by defining the desired state of a set of pods in a YAML file, which is then submitted to the Kubernetes API for deployment. The Service provides a stable IP address and DNS name for accessing the pods and automatically load balances traffic to the pods.

Example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
name: myservice
spec:
selector:
app: myapp
ports:

name: myport
port: 80
targetPort: 80
type: ClusterIP



9. Ingress: An Ingress is a resource that defines a set of rules for routing external traffic to services in a cluster.
Implementation: An Ingress is created by defining the desired state of a set of routing rules in a YAML file, which is then submitted to the Kubernetes API for deployment. The Ingress provides a way to route external traffic to services in the cluster based on the hostname and path of the request.

Example:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
name: myingress
annotations:
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
rules:

host: myhost.com
http:
paths:
path: /mypath
pathType: Prefix
backend:
service:
name: myservice
port:
name: myport



10. Job: A Job is a resource that manages a finite, batch workload in a cluster. It ensures that a specified number of pods run to completion.
Implementation: A Job is created by defining the desired state of a batch workload in a YAML file, which is then submitted to the Kubernetes API for deployment. The Job ensures that the specified number of pods run to completion and provides options for handling failed pods.

Example:

apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
name: myjob
spec:
template:
metadata:
name: myjob
spec:
containers:
- name: mycontainer
image: myimage:v1
restartPolicy: Never
backoffLimit: 4


11. Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC): PVs and PVCs are resources that provide persistent storage to pods. A PV is a raw block storage resource that is available in a cluster, and a PVC is a request for a specific amount of storage from a PV.
Implementation: A PV is created by defining the desired state of a block storage resource in a YAML file, which is then submitted to the Kubernetes API for deployment. A PVC is created by defining the desired state of a request for storage in a YAML file, which is then submitted to the Kubernetes API for deployment. The PVC is automatically bound to an available PV that meets its requirements.

Example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
name: mypv
spec:
capacity:
storage: 1Gi
accessModes:

ReadWriteOnce
hostPath:
path: /mnt/data

metadata:
name: mypvc
spec:
accessModes:

ReadWriteOnce
resources:
requests:
storage: 1Gi


12. Namespace: A Namespace is a resource that provides a way to partition a cluster into multiple virtual clusters. Each namespace has its own set of resources, such as pods and services.
Implementation: A Namespace is created by defining the desired state of a namespace in a YAML file, which is then submitted to the Kubernetes API for deployment. The Namespace can be used to isolate resources and control access to them.

Example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
name: mynamespace
